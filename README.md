`Debugger` is a 2D puzzle game based on the premise “catch bugs to fix bugs.” In a world crawling with bugs that bend the rules of reality, play as a young Bug Hunter venturing out in the field for the first time. Learn the behavior of your prey and turn that knowledge against them to clear levels! Learn more about the world you reside in and yourself through conversations with other denizens of the Digital Plane!

[Demo](https://raddishradish.itch.io/debugger-srs) developed January 2022 - May 2022 as part of [Students Run Studios](https://itch.io/c/2529704/students-run-studios-2022), a program by [ACM Game Studio at UCLA](https://uclaacmstudio.itch.io/) through which students learn to develop a game collaboratively over two school quarters. We are continuing development of the game over the summer and appreciate any comments or feedback!
